1. Problem Statement:
Design a web application “Hourly Recruitment Application” to allow anyone to sign up as a 
recruiter or as a worker.
1.1. What is an Hourly Recruitment Application?
A platform for clients and freelancers from all around the world to work together for mutual 
benefit is Hourly Recruitment Application. If someone or a company needs professional labor 
for a short-term or long-term project, they can post it and invite freelancers to submit bids to 
complete it. The freelancers then can bid the amount they wish and at the end the recruiter can 
choose anyone. Upon mutual understanding from both the parties the contract work begins and 
upon successful completion of the work the contract ends.
Now that you understand what Hourly Recruitment Application is, let’s discuss some of the 
functionality of the “Hourly Recruitment Application” that you will design.
1. To create a web-based system that will let the users sign up as either a client or as a 
freelancer.
2. The clients can then post a job along with the necessary job requirements.
3. The freelancers can see the job posted and can start bidding with their quotes and time 
period they require to finish the task.
4. The client can then see all the bids and select any one bidder and upon mutual agreement the 
contract will begin.
5. As soon as both the parties agree the funds will be locked in the app wallet. The client will 
pay the agreed amount.
6. Once the work has been delivered and the client is satisfied the funds which are frozen in the 
app wallet can then be released to the freelancer, thus ending the contract

● Proper readme file you have to maintain for any project development. 
● You should include the basic workflow and execution of the entire project in the readme 
file on GitHub.
